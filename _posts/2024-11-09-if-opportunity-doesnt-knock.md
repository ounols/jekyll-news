In operant conditioning, a reinforcement (by reward) or instead a punishment is given after a given behavior, changing the frequency and/or form of that behavior.

If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door. This powerful mindset shift transforms us from passive waiters into active creators of our own destiny.

## Taking Initiative

Instead of waiting for opportunities to come to us, we can:

- **Create Opportunities**: Build your own path
- **Take Risks**: Step outside your comfort zone
- **Be Proactive**: Make things happen
- **Stay Persistent**: Keep building even when it's hard

## Building Your Door

Creating opportunities requires:

1. **Vision**: See what's possible
2. **Courage**: Take the first step
3. **Resourcefulness**: Use what you have
4. **Resilience**: Keep going despite setbacks

## The Power of Action

When we build our own doors, we:

- **Gain Confidence**: Prove to ourselves what's possible
- **Learn Skills**: Develop new capabilities
- **Create Value**: Make something others can benefit from
- **Inspire Others**: Show that it can be done

## Conclusion

If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door. Don't wait for permission or perfect conditions. Start where you are, use what you have, and create the opportunities you need to succeed.
