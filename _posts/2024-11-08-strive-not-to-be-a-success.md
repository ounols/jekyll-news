In operant conditioning, a reinforcement (by reward) or instead a punishment is given after a given behavior, changing the frequency and/or form of that behavior.

Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value. This shift in focus transforms how we approach our work, relationships, and life itself.

## Success vs. Value

The difference between success and value:

- **Success**: Often measured by external metrics
- **Value**: Measured by the impact we have on others
- **Success**: Can be fleeting and dependent on circumstances
- **Value**: Creates lasting positive change

## Being of Value

To be of value means:

1. **Solve Problems**: Address real needs
2. **Help Others**: Contribute to their success
3. **Share Knowledge**: Teach and mentor
4. **Create Meaning**: Build things that matter

## The Technology Connection

In technology, being of value means:

- Building tools that solve real problems
- Creating user experiences that improve lives
- Sharing knowledge through open source
- Using technology for positive impact

## Long-term Impact

When we focus on value:

- **Legacy**: We create lasting impact
- **Relationships**: We build trust and connection
- **Fulfillment**: We find deeper satisfaction
- **Growth**: We continuously improve

## Conclusion

Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value. When we shift our focus from personal achievement to meaningful contribution, we create a life that's both successful and deeply fulfilling.
