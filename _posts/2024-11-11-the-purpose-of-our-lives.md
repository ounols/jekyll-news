In operant conditioning, a reinforcement (by reward) or instead a punishment is given after a given behavior, changing the frequency and/or form of that behavior.

The purpose of our lives is to be happy. This simple yet profound truth guides us toward a life of fulfillment and meaning. Happiness isn't a destination—it's a way of living.

## Finding Happiness

Happiness comes from:

- **Gratitude**: Appreciating what we have
- **Connection**: Building meaningful relationships
- **Purpose**: Doing work that matters
- **Growth**: Continuously learning and evolving

## Living with Purpose

When we align our actions with our values and purpose, happiness naturally follows. It's not about having everything, but about finding meaning in what we do and who we are.

## Conclusion

The purpose of our lives is to be happy. Make choices that bring you joy, surround yourself with people who lift you up, and always remember that happiness is a journey, not a destination.
