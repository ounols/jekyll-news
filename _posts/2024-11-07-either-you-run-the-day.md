In operant conditioning, a reinforcement (by reward) or instead a punishment is given after a given behavior, changing the frequency and/or form of that behavior.

Either you run the day, or the day runs you. This powerful choice determines whether we're proactive creators or reactive responders in our own lives.

## Taking Control

Running your day means:

- **Planning Ahead**: Setting intentions the night before

## When the Day Runs You

Signs that the day is running you:

- Constantly reacting to others' demands
- Feeling overwhelmed and behind
- No time for your own priorities
- Stress and burnout

## Strategies for Running Your Day

1. **Morning Routine**: Start with intention
2. **Time Blocking**: Schedule important tasks
